# Introduction

The Director of Neighbourhoods wants to understand more about road traffic crashes in Bradford. You, the HDRC data scientist, have been asked to give some insight into road traffic crashes in Bradford.

Therefore, your task is to:
1) examine this Bradford road traffic crash data;
2) identify and display insights; and
3) give us a 10 minute presentation during your interview about the work you have done â€“ this should include slides that showcase your work

# Questions/ areas of interest
Casualty 'hotspots'
Volume of casualties from 2018 to 2020 - how do they compare
Different types of casualties
Pedestrians and cyclists
Summary statistics (count, percentage initially)

There are casualty 'peaks' in October which is not uncommon and may be due to the switch from BST to GMT.

85% of pedestrian casualties involve a car; 44% involve a car, but 50% involve a pedal cycle... which is sort of obvious, but may also be attributable to potholes, uneven road surfaces or other types of incidents - would be interesting to find out.

Let's have a look at the categories of casualty_severity for each time period

```{r further-exploration-code, include=FALSE}
# This shows the number of casualties by severity
# Initially I was only going to look at serious or fatal, but then went for all types as the slight casualties may lead to serious or fatal if not managed
bradford_rta %>% 
  #filter(casualty_severity %in% c("Serious", "Fatal")) %>% 
  group_by(casualty_severity, casualty_type) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  print(n = Inf)

# Illustrated in a horizontal bar chart
bradford_rta %>% 
  #filter(casualty_severity %in% c("Serious", "Fatal")) %>% 
  group_by(casualty_severity, casualty_type) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = casualty_type, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity',
           width = 0.8) +
  geom_text(aes(label=n),
            hjust = -0.15) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(y = "Number of casualties") +
  facet_grid(~casualty_severity) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 25)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 8, colour = "black"),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 12))

# Might need to zoom to get the full image

# Physical activity is important, so I will narrow down the type of casualty to pedestrians and cyclists
# Illustrated in a horizontal bar chart

seriousness <- bradford_rta %>% 
  filter(casualty_type %in% c("Cyclist", "Pedestrian")) %>% 
  group_by(casualty_severity, casualty_type) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())

seriousness %>% 
           ggplot(aes(x = casualty_type,
             y = n,,
             # fill = casualty_severity,
             text = paste("</br>Severity: ", casualty_severity,
                          "</br>Type: ", casualty_type,

  # coord_flip() +

       y = "Number of casualties") +
  facet_grid(~casualty_severity) +
  #scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 25)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, vjust = -1),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 8, colour = "black"),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),

Pedestrians and cyclists are not faring too well on Bradford's roads...

With the magic of {leaflet}, we can see where the hotspots occur for subgroups of pedestrians and cyclists.

# Reduce the size of the shapefile to make R less likely to crash
bradford <- st_simplify(bradford, preserveTopology = TRUE, dTolerance = 1000)

# Remove the larger shapefile
rm(uk)

# I want to show accident hotspots on the map, so I combine the accident data with the shapefile - don't have to do it this way, but it can be helfpul in the eventualty of using packages like crosstalk
